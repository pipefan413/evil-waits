----  ABOUT THIS PROJECT  ------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HALLOWEEN (1978) is a film notorious for home video re-releases. As of November
2019, there is still no truly definitive release. A particularly contentious
problem is not including the original 1978 mono sound mix, even if the packaging
says otherwise. This is problematic because the sound mixes used instead are
based on a remaster done in 1997, which significantly changed the music and
sound effects from their original presentation. In addition, many audio options
have remained exclusive to specific releases which have since gone out of print
so are now extremely difficult to purchase brand new (and expensive/awkward to
buy second-hand, especially if you live outside the US).

The aim of this project is very simple: to compile a reasonably comprehensive
collection of the different audio tracks available for the film. Think of it as
an equivalent to my STAR WARS audio archive project MILLIONS OF VOICES, except
that the video is not included here because it would be an otherwise unaltered
remux of a currently available retail release, which you should legally own if
you're downloading this anyway.

The idea is that you can take your desired video file - ideally an MKV, perhaps
ripped from your retail Blu-ray Disc - and combine it with one or more of the
audio files in this release by muxing them together in MKVToolNix or similar.

Compatible video tracks include, but are not necessarily limited to:

1. 35th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Discs from 2013 onwards [Anchor Bay / Starz]
2. The first Blu-ray Disc release from 2007 [Anchor Bay / Starz]
3. Fundamental Collection #006, spoRv's 2017 restoration of the 1997 THX colours

In the unlikely even that the video from the 35th Anniversary release goes out
of print any time soon, I may release another version of this archive which
includes it as an MKV file (otherwise unaltered to retain quality).

----  ORIGINAL 1978 MIX  -------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tracks present the film's sound mix as it was originally heard, in
3 different encodes of varying quality. These are much more difficult to find
than they should be. At time of writing in November 2019, only the 2007 version
(which has the lowest bitrate and is not lossless) is still available, and that
too will likely soon disappear as it has been replaced by the 35th Anniversary
Edition as of 2013.

DESC: 16-bit PCM original 1978 mono mix (from 1994 LD)
FILE: Original_mix_1994_1.0_PCM.wav
INFO: Quite a lot of tape hiss but it sounded a lot like this in cinemas

DESC: 192Kbps Dolby Digital 2.0 original mix remastered (from 2007 BD)
FILE: Original_mix_2007_2.0_DD.ac3
INFO: Reduced tape hiss but encoded in lossy 192Kbps format

DESC: Dolby TrueHD 2.0 original mix remastered (from 2014 BD)
FILE: Original_mix_2014_2.0_TrueHD.mka
INFO: Reduced tape hiss, finally encoded on BD in a lossless format!

----  REMIXES  -----------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 1997, as part of the THX restoration for DVD, the film's sound was remixed by
Chace Productions in association with frequent John Carpenter collaborator Alan
Howarth. Unfortunately, some pretty questionable liberties were taken with the
material, with a number of additional sound effects being added and the iconic
1978 John Carpenter music even being changed (it's re-voiced in places with a
different synthesiser). If it had been localised to this release, this wouldn't
have been a major problem, but every home video release has prioritised this
revisionist 1997 remix over the original 1978 one ever since. Apart from using
this questionable 1997 work as a base, though, some of these sound pretty good.
The 7.1 surround track in particular will indeed, in the words of Will Smith,
boom (shake the room).

DESC: 16-bit PCM 5.1 remix (from 2007 BD)*
FILE: Remix_2007_5.1_PCM.wav
INFO: This has a very high bitrate, higher even than the later 7.1 mix

DESC: Dolby TrueHD 7.1 remix (from 2013 BD)
FILE: Remix_2013_7.1_TrueHD.mka
INFO: The latest surround mix for up to date 7.1 setups; I almost didn't include
      this since it's already on the current retail release, but that would've
      sucked for those who only have the original 2007 Blu-ray Disc and want to
      mux the 7.1 mix into the video from that

DESC: 192Kbps Dolby Digital 2.0 remix (from 2013 BD)
FILE: Remix_2013_2.0_DD.ac3
INFO: Lossy stereo; provided only for those who for some reason want to hear the
      remixed audio but don't have surround sound and only have the 2007 BD
      rather than the 2013 BD this was pulled from

* A lossy Dolby Digital (AC3) version of the 5.1 mix was also featured on the
2007 BD, and later on the 2013 BD for those without a 7.1 setup. However, the
lossy encode is already on every retail release from 2007 onwards, so would be
pointless to include here. Conversely, the PCM track remains exclusive to the
old 2007 disc and is technically superior, which is why that one has been
included.

----  COMMENTARIES  ------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So far, there have been three unique commentaries recorded for the original
film. Of the three, only one is currently in print and widely available (the
one from the 2013 Blu-ray Disc release).

DESC: 1994 LD commentary (John Carpenter, Debra Hill & Jamie Lee Curtis)
FILE: Commentary_1994_1.0_DD.ac3
FILE: Commentary_1994_2.0_DD.ac3
INFO: Two versions here, one from the original 1994 LaserDisc with a fair bit of
      background hiss, one from the 2007 Blu-ray Disc with much less hiss and a
      2.0 rather than 1.0 presentation

DESC: 2013 BD commentary (John Carpenter & Jamie Lee Curtis)
FILE: Commentary_2013_2.0_DD.ac3
INFO: Provided for those who have the 2007 BD but not the 2013 one

DESC: 2014 BD commentary (Nick Castle, Dean Cundey & Tommy Lee Wallace)
FILE: Commentary_2014_2.0_DD.ac3
INFO: Exclusive to 2014 Complete Collection BD box set, now out of print

----  ISOLATED MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS  ------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a bit of a curio, having only ever been released on LaserDisc. It's the
original mono audio track but with all of the dialogue removed, basically,
leaving only the music and sound effects. A weird but interesting experience.

DESC: Isolated music & effects (from 1994 LD)
FILE: Music_&_Effects_1994_1.0_PCM.wav
INFO: Being from the 1994 LaserDisc, this has the same background hiss as the
      other two LaserDisc tracks
