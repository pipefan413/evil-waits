----  ABOUT THIS PROJECT  ------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this project is very simple: to compile a reasonably comprehensive
collection of the different audio tracks available for John Carpenter's 1978
horror classic, HALLOWEEN. Think of it as an equivalent to my STAR WARS audio
archive project, MILLIONS OF VOICES. This new version is pre-muxed with video,
aiming toward a specific goal: to recreate the experience of watching the 1997
THX restoration that was released on DVD, with upgraded video and audio quality.

The video that appears here is spoRv's FUNDAMENTAL COLLECTION #006: HALLOWEEN,
the whole point of which was to reproduce the warmer, "autumnal" colour grading
seen on the THX DVD restoration but in 1080p HD. Newer releases, especially the
most recent "35th Anniversary Edition" restoration, have instead aimed to more
accurately reproduce the original 1978 theatrical colours, which were cooler and
more muted.

In addition to digitally regrading the colours in the video, the 1997 THX
restoration also changed the audio mix significantly, overdubbing some of the
synthesised music and adding new sound effects. Every single audio track
included in the DVD release was one of these new remixes, done by Chace
Productions in association with frequent John Carpenter collaborator Alan
Howarth. Like the colour regrade, the revisionist audio is highly contentious
amongst a lot of fans. However, that is how it sounded in 1997, and for many,
many years since (all the way up to the current retail release, which
prioritises a 7.1 surround mix built from the work done in 1997). Here are the
three audio tracks that appear on my 2005 PAL DVD copy ("25 Years Of Terror", a
4-disc reissue of the THX restoration with a slew of special features):

1. 5.1 mix (Dolby Digital, 448Kbps)
2. 4.0 mix (Dolby Digital, 192Kbps)
3. 2.0 mix (Dolby Digital, 192Kbps)

This new release sources audio tracks from the 1994 LaserDisc, the 2007 Blu-ray
Disc, the 2013 Blu-ray Disc ("35th Anniversary Edition") and disc 1 of the
limited edition Halloween: The Complete Collection Blu-ray Disc box set. All but
the 2013 Blu-ray Disc are currently out of print, so most of these tracks are
not easy to find. Here is the new list of audio options for this release:
