----  ABOUT THIS PROJECT  ------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this project is very simple: to compile a reasonably comprehensive
collection of the different audio tracks available for John Carpenter's 1978
horror classic, HALLOWEEN. Think of it as an equivalent to my STAR WARS audio
archive project, MILLIONS OF VOICES. This new version is pre-muxed with video,
aiming toward a specific goal: to recreate the experience of watching the 1997
THX restoration that was released on DVD, with upgraded video and audio quality.

The video that appears here is spoRv's FUNDAMENTAL COLLECTION #006: HALLOWEEN,
the whole point of which was to reproduce the warmer, "autumnal" colour grading
seen on the THX DVD restoration but in 1080p HD. Newer releases, especially the
most recent "35th Anniversary Edition" restoration, have instead aimed to more
accurately reproduce the original 1978 theatrical colours, which were cooler and
more muted.

In addition to digitally regrading the colours in the video, the 1997 THX
restoration also changed the audio mix significantly, overdubbing some of the
synthesised music and adding new sound effects. Every single audio track
included in the DVD release was one of these new remixes, done by Chace
Productions in association with frequent John Carpenter collaborator Alan
Howarth. Like the colour regrade, the revisionist audio is highly contentious
amongst a lot of fans. However, that is how it sounded in 1997, and for many,
many years since (all the way up to the current retail release, which
prioritises a 7.1 surround mix built from the work done in 1997). Here are the
three audio tracks that appear on my 2005 PAL DVD copy ("25 Years Of Terror", a
4-disc reissue of the THX restoration with a slew of special features):

1. 5.1 mix (Dolby Digital, 448Kbps)
2. 4.0 mix (Dolby Digital, 192Kbps)
3. 2.0 mix (Dolby Digital, 192Kbps)

This new release sources audio tracks from the 1994 LaserDisc, the 2007 Blu-ray
Disc, the 2013 Blu-ray Disc ("35th Anniversary Edition") and disc 1 of the
limited edition Halloween: The Complete Collection Blu-ray Disc box set. All but
the 2013 Blu-ray Disc are currently out of print, so many of these tracks are
not easy to find.

Audio tracks for this streaming version are a little different, both to keep the
filesize down and to limit the total bitrate since this version is targeted
toward streaming off a media server. The total bitrate has been kept at 8Mbps,
the same as my previous streaming optimised release of this film (my HALLOWEEN:
EVIL WAITS fanedit). However, that release only had 192Kbps mono audio, whereas
this new one includes a 640Kbps 5.1 surround track, which means the audio takes
up more of the bitrate. The video bitrate reduction should be visually
negligible, though, since we're only talking about 448Kbps at most.

One other slight difference from my previous streaming optimised releases is
that I've kept the letterboxing black bars in this one. This is for no reason
other than that I wanted to keep the two subtitle options available: one in the
black bar at the bottom, one above the bar in the frame itself. The difference
in keeping the bars in the encode is pretty small anyway, so this shouldn't
really be a practical concern for anybody.


Here is the new list of audio options for this release:

1997 REMIXES:
1. 5.1 remix (from 2007 BD) [Dolby Digital, 640Kbps]
2. 2.0 remix (from 2013 BD) [Dolby Digital, 192Kbps]

1978 MIX:
3. 1.0 original 1978 mix (from 1994 LD) [AAC, 192Kbps]*

COMMENTARIES:
4. 1994 LaserDisc commentary (2007 BD remaster) [Dolby Digital, 192Kbps]*
5. 2013 Blu-ray Disc commentary [Dolby Digital, 192Kbps]
6. 2014 Blu-ray Disc commentary [Dolby Digital, 192Kbps]*


In other words, I have replaced the higher-quality PCM version of the 5.1 track
with the Dolby Digital one and transcoded the PCM mono track to 192Kbps AAC.
Apart from that, I have kept the 7.1 TrueHD remix, the 2.0 TrueHD remaster of
the original mix, and the isolated music & effects tracks exclusive to the
original releases (the original DIY audio archive and the full size version of
this THX Edition).


Tracks marked with a * are currently exclusive to out of print releases.
