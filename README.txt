This is mostly Halloween as we know it, but with a few tweaks:

1. The original mono audio has been reinstated (in lossless 16-bit PCM) and the
   TV audio has been level boosted by approximately 5dB so that it is no longer
   significantly quieter than the rest of the film.

2. I have added a new prologue consisting of a re-edited presentation of one of
   the scenes shot for the 1980 TV cut. As well as cutting some shots and
   rearranging others, I regraded the colour to somewhat more closely
   approximate the DP-approved "35th Anniversary Edition", since that was my
   source for the rest of the footage.
   
3. 10 frames have been trimmed from the start of the opening titles so that the
   timing of the main theme kicking in after the new prologue is more satisfying
   (you can almost count the theme in with a bar of 5/4 at the right tempo).
   
4. The whole thing has been re-encoded down ever so slightly to a video bitrate
   of around 35Mbps so that it'll fit onto a 25GB Blu-ray disc with a little
   room left for a menu and potentially a bonus video or two if you like. The
   direct rip of the unedited film was 36.2Mbps and slightly too big at 25.5GB,
   but this release is around 22.9GB. I have attempted to ensure that it's
   disc-compatible, but I don't reckon I want it on disc myself so burn at your
   own discretion (you might want to inspect the file closely before authoring).


I did this after re-watching Croweyes1121's Halloween: Revised Extended Edition,
which adds the 1980 TV scenes to spoRv's THX-esque regraded release (Fundamental
Collection #006). Whilst I love that release as an alternative way to watch the
film, I find the TV scenes to be distractingly mismatched with everything else,
and they mess with the flow of the edit significantly. However, one scene
between Loomis and young Michael in Smith's Grove stood out to me in a good way.
I do not feel that it sits well where it was placed for the extended TV cut, but
I thought it might work as a brief prologue to the original theatrical cut.
That's exactly what I've done with this edit.

Enjoy!

VIDEO:

1. 2013 "35th Anniversary Edition" Blu-ray Disc (H.264/MKV remux)

   This release was reportedly regraded under supervision of DP Dean Cundey and
   director John Carpenter to look as close to their original intention as they
   could recall. It looks significantly different from every other release I've
   seen, apart from a 35mm print that I saw screened several years ago which did
   indeed match this relatively closely, or at least didn't have the orange tint
   seen on the 1999 THX DVD as far as I can remember.
   
2. Halloween: Revised Extended Edition by Croweyes1121 (TV footage only)

   This had been regraded toward an "autumnal" orange tint to approximate the
   1999 THX DVD colours, which are pretty ridiculous when put beside the much
   cooler and more muted palette of the 35th Anniversary Edition (Loomis looked
   like he had just dropped by Smith's Grove directly after a visit to the
   tanning salon). However, my only other available source was the isolated TV
   footage from the Blu-ray special features, which is interlaced 1080i (eugh!)
   rather than 1080p, so I just regraded the colours of this instead.
   
   It isn't perfect because I haven't regraded each shot individually (for some
   reason they're not even matched with each other in any of the sources
   available, with some shots looking warmer than others) but it's certainly
   much closer to the 2013 "theatrical" grading than it was when I got it. If I
   can get hold of the 2014 US Complete Collection bonus disc to strip the TV
   footage from, I would perhaps like to revisit this, but I'm happy enough with
   it as is for the time being and wanted it out by Halloween!


AUDIO:

1. 1994 Criterion Collection US LaserDisc:
   - Original 1978 mono mix (lossless 16-bit PCM)

   This was obtained indirectly via spoRv's Fundamental Collection #006. It has
   been upsampled from its LaserDisc-native 44.1kHz sample rate to 48kHz for
   Blu-ray Disc compatibility.

2. Halloween: Revised Extended Edition by Croweyes1121 (TV footage only):
   - Original 1980 mono mix (lossless 16-bit PCM)
   
   As mentioned previously, I had to boost this by a little over 5dB to bring
   it more in line with the rest of the audio from the theatrical cut.
